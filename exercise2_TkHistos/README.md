# POS2017 TRK-POG

## exercise2: analyze tracks & vertices 

Measure the impact parameter resolution w/r/t the primary vertex in the transverse and longitudinal planes
1. for different transverse momenta and pseudo-rapidities
2. for track with and w/o a hit in the first layer of the pixel detector
3. check that the error associated to the IP in the track corresponds to what you measure


tips:
start from tkHistos.ipynb
look for reco::Track reco::Vertex and HitPattern "documentation"
