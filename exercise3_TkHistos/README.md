## Excercise3: navigation, progation, pattern-recognition

1) start from _RecoTracker/MeasurementDet/test/MeasurementTrackerTest.cc_
2) Modify it to find hits "around" your trajectory on each detector crossed
3) Run it on highPU events...

### Bonus
1) Try to apply Kalman Filtering while navigating
2) use some sort of "real" track to start the process


hints
you need to consume a *MeasurementTrackerEvent* and use a *LayerMeasurements*
